        Args:
            username: The name of the user whose ACL is to be created or updated.
            enabled: Indicates whether the user should be allowed to authenticate.
                     Defaults to `False`.
            nopass: Indicates whether the user can authenticate without a password.
                    This cannot be `True` if `passwords` are also specified.
            passwords: A list of plain text passwords to add to or remove from the user.
                       Each password must be prefixed with a '+' to add or a '-' to
                       remove. For convenience, a single prefixed string can be used

                              from the user. Each hashed password must be prefixed with
                              a '+' to add or a '-' to remove. For convenience, a single

                        must be prefixed with either a '+' to add the category
                        permission or a '-' to remove the category permission.
            commands: A list of strings representing command permissions. Each string
                      must be prefixed with either a '+' to add the command permission
                      or a '-' to remove the command permission.
            keys: A list of key patterns to grant the user access to. Key patterns allow
                  '*' to support wildcard matching. For example, '*' grants access to
                  all keys while 'cache:*' grants access to all keys that are prefixed
                  with 'cache:'. `keys` should not be prefixed with a '~'.
            reset: Indicates whether the user should be fully reset prior to applying
                   the new ACL. Setting this to `True` will remove all existing
                   passwords, flags, and privileges from the user and then apply the
                   specified rules. If `False`, the user's existing passwords, flags,
                   and privileges will be kept and any new specified rules will be
                   applied on top.
            reset_keys: Indicates whether the user's key permissions should be reset
                        prior to applying any new key permissions specified in `keys`.
                        If `False`, the user's existing key permissions will be kept and
                        any new specified key permissions will be applied on top.
            reset_channels: Indicates whether the user's channel permissions should be
                            reset prior to applying any new channel permissions
                            specified in `channels`. If `False`, the user's existing
